## ORFtrack inputs

ORFtrack takes as inputs:

 * a fasta file containing the nucleotide sequences
of the chromosomes or contigs of a genome
 * the genome annotation in a gff file (see 
[the GFF3 documentation](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md)
for more details on the gff3 format).

These files must be stored together in a local directory that will be linked to the /database/ directory of the container (see [here](./orfmine_quickstart.md#prepare-your-folders) for more details).

See an example of inputs in the ORFmine/examples/database directory.
