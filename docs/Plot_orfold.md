# Plot of the ORFold output


The output table generated by ORFold can be subsequently given to ORFold 
to generate a plot of the HCA score distribution. 
The user can provide several tables in order to compare different HCA score
distribution. In this case, ORFplot will plot all the distributions on the same plot
(the tables must be given with the **-tab** option). 
By default, the names used in the legend of the resulting plot 
are the root names of the input table files. 
However, the user can write his own names in the legend 
with the **-names** option. The names must be given in the same order 
as the table files. 

	plot_orfold -tab sequences_Y.tab sequences_X.tab sequences_Z.tab

This example will generate the HCA score distributions of the sequences 
stored in the sequences_Y.tab, sequences_X.tab and sequences_Z.tab files. 
The resulting legend will be sequences_Y, sequences_X, and sequences_Z respectively. 

	plot_orfold -tab sequences_Y.tab sequences_X.tab sequences_Z.tab -names Noncoding Coding Translated

This example will generate the HCA score distributions of the sequences 
stored in the sequences_Y.tab, sequences_X.tab and sequences_Z.tab files.
The resulting legend will be Noncoding, Coding and Translated, respectively.

        If the names consist of single words the user can write them the 
one after the other as shown in the example above. However, if the user 
wishes to use multiple words in the legend labels (ie Noncoding sequences - 
Homo sapiens , Coding sequences - Homo sapiens, Translated sequences - 
Homo sapiens) they must be enclosed in double quotes. 
```{}
	plot_orfold -tab sequences_Y.tab sequences_X.tab sequences_Z.tab -names "Noncoding sequences - Homo sapiens" "Coding sequences - Homo sapiens" "Translated sequences - Homo sapiens"
```
