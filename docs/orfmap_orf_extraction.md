## ORF extraction

The amino acid and nucleotide sequences of all ORFs identified 
with ORFmap can be extracted easily with ORFget, a tool provided with
ORFmap. Particularly, ORFget enables the user to extract the 
sequences of all identified ORFs (c_CDS, noncoding intergenic,
or noncoding overlapping ORFs), but also, those of a specific ORF
category (e.g. only noncoding intergenic ORFs) or a combination 
of ORFs according to their annotations (e.g. noncoding intergenic
ORFs and noncoding ORFs that overlap lncRNAs...). Different 
examples are detailed in the [ORFget section](./orfget_run.md).
