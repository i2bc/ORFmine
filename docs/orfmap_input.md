## ORFmap inputs

ORFmap takes as inputs:

 * a FASTA file containing the nucleotide sequences
of the chromosomes or contigs of a genome
 * the genome annotation in a GFF file (see 
[the GFF3 documentation](https://github.com/The-Sequence-Ontology/Specifications/blob/master/gff3.md)
for more details on the GFF3 format).

See an example of inputs in the ORFmine/examples/ directory.
