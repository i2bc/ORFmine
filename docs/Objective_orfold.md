# Aims and general description of ORFold

ORFold aims at estimating the foldability potential of a single or multiple amino acid sequence(s) using the **Hydrophobic Clusters Analysis (HCA)** method [REF]. Foldability is defined as the ability of an amino acid sequence to fold to a stable 3D structure or to fold to a molten globule state in which the specific tertiary structure is lost whereas the secondary structures are intact.

ORFold calculates the HCA foldability score for each given sequence. This score is based on the enrichment of the sequence in regions with high density of hydrophobic residues (called Hydrophobic Clusters) and consists an indication for the ability of a sequence to fold under solution. Further more, ORFold can predict the disorder and/or aggregation propensity of each sequence using the **IUPred** and **Tango** methods respectively.
