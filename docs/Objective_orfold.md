# Aims and general description of ORFold

ORFold aims at estimating the fold potential of a set of amino acid sequences
using the Hydrophobic Clusters Analysis (HCA) method [1]. 
We define the foldability of an amino acid sequence as its ability 
to fold to a stable 3D structure or to a molten globule state in which the specific 
tertiary structure is lost whereas the secondary structures are intact.

ORFold calculates the HCA foldability score of each given sequence. 
Furthermore, ORFold can estimate the 
disorder and/or aggregation propensities of the input sequences using 
the IUPred[2][3][4] and Tango[5][6][7] methods respectively.
